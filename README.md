# WHAT DO YOU PREFER?

Intoducing my new app to sort your favourite spotify playlist. It uses an adapted binary insertion algorithm and the `spotipy api` to interact with the users account and access some data. It features some awfully written `html/css/js` and some I hope not so awful `python`.

## Features

- It shows 2 songs and you chose one oh them by clicking anywhere on it side.
- If you put the mouse on it side it shows you the song information.
- If you put the mouse over the white circle with the green bars you can hear the song.
- In any stage you can save the game as a `.json` file with the "Exit and Save the Game" button
- You can load either your playlist link to start a game or the json file to continue
- In the end you can either download your sorted list as a `.txt` file or turn it into a new spotify playlist (it doesn't delete the original one)

### Thanks for your attention
